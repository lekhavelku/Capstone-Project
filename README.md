# Capstone-Project
 Predict the Call cnts for emergecy roadsiervice car breakdown call volume for the contact centers or dispatch centers.
 1.	What is the problem you want to solve?
    I would like to predict the call counts for emergency roadside assistance calls.

2.	Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?
  This will help the client to facilitate the necessary roadside facility trucks arrangement as per the prediction and be prepared.

3.	What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
   I used the data from the emergency roadside assistance calls data from the system and masked it to. And also used weather underground    data from www.weatherunderground.com

5.	In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).
